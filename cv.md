I’m developer in the field of Frontend development and determined to become a full-stack developer. I am originally from Russia, but now I live in Belarus, Gomel. I like to bring visual designs to life, make them functional through the use of coding.  I have a passion for excellence and I am really committed to achieving the best possible results.

**My purposes**: Styding and improving knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript technologies. Study React (React Native, Redux), NodeJS.  
**My strengths**:  I’m driven to succeed and deliver results. And I have the ability to learn new technologies quickly.
