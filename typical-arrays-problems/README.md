# Typical Arrays Problems

## Task
There are a few typical problems while you working with arrays, and your goal is to solve it.

You should implement 3 functions: `max`, `min`, and `avg` for searching minimal value, maximal value, and an average value of a given array.

For example:
```js
min(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 1;
max(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 4;
avg(1, 2, 3, 4) // returns 2.5;
```

Please note, that you should return 0 if no params specified or an empty array passed

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
2. Fork this repository: typical-arrays-problems
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://github.com/<%your_github_username%>/typical-arrays-problems/  
4. Go to folder `typical-arrays-problems`  
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)  
6. Run `npm test` in the command line  
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests you 100% of passing tests is equal to 100p in score  

## Submit to [rs app](https://app.rs.school)
1. Open [rs app](https://app.rs.school) and login
2. Go to [submit task page](https://app.rs.school/course/student/auto-test?course=rs-2020-q1)
